we are pulling in the local file for the d3 library. it is inside the libs folder and is a javascript file type. 
we are using the v4 of d3 - this is the latest developed version with all the best revisions. still, as with any versioning system (think of your iPhone and all the apps in various updated versions - sometimes we will have to do some double-checking on things that we used to be able to do in the previous version)
- that's all noted here: https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/CHANGES.md
the "min" part of the file name just means that the file has been reduced to its most compact version - this will load faster than a version with lots of white space, comments and spaces
